# websecmon
Websecmon is a tool to detect and monitor vulnerabilites on websites

This project is still in early development phase.

Some things that websecmon can monitor for you (examples of planned features):
* Check webserver for open ports using nmap
* Check webserver for hidden files using snallygaster
* Check webserver encyrption configuration and webserver certificate (is a trusted one, is still valid)
