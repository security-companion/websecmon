.. With Websecmon you can scan your website or a website you are in charge of for security issues.

In order to use the tool you first need to install it on a server or use the hosted version on TODO

Once you register your username you can add a website to check.
Before it being scanned you need to confirm the right to do so by

- verifying that you have access to a mail-address that is part of the domain-name you want to scan.
- adding a certain file that websec provides to the webspace of the domain
